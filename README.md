# 🏥 Healthcare Readmission Risk Prediction

**An End-to-End, Production-Style Data Science Project (Python + SQL)**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are a major challenge for healthcare systems. They increase costs, strain resources, and often indicate gaps in care quality.

This project builds a **complete, real-world data science pipeline** to predict **30-day hospital readmission risk**, using healthcare data and production-style engineering practices.

The repository is designed to serve **two purposes at once**:

1. 📘 **A step-by-step learning guide** for anyone starting in data science
2. 💼 **A professional portfolio project** demonstrating real industry skills

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

> **Predict whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after discharge.**

This is framed as a **binary classification problem**, with special attention to:

- Class imbalance
- Healthcare-appropriate evaluation metrics
- Model interpretability and trust

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Is Different

Most data science projects stop at _“train a model and show accuracy.”_
This one focuses on **how data science actually works in real teams**.

✔ SQL-first data analysis
✔ Reproducible pipelines
✔ Production-ready project structure
✔ Healthcare-specific reasoning
✔ Explainable ML (SHAP)
✔ Simple deployment for inference

---

## 🧪 Dataset

The project uses the **Diabetes 130-US Hospitals Dataset** from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository

**Key characteristics:**

- Real hospital encounter data
- Demographics, diagnoses, medications, lab results
- Readmission outcome variable
- Messy, imperfect data (just like real life)

📄 Detailed feature descriptions are available in `docs/data_dictionary.md`.

## 📊 Evaluation Philosophy

In healthcare, **accuracy alone is not enough**.

Primary metrics:

- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

Special emphasis is placed on:

- False negatives (missed high-risk patients)
- Model transparency and trust

---

## 🚀 Deployment

A lightweight **Streamlit application** allows users to:

- Input patient details
- Get predicted readmission risk
- Understand which features influenced the decision

This simulates a real internal clinical analytics tool.

## 🗄️ Database Setup — From Installed to Working

> **Goal:** Move from a freshly installed PostgreSQL → a populated, queryable project database.

---

### ✅ Step 1 — Verify PostgreSQL Is Running

Open **Command Prompt / Terminal** and run:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

If prompted, enter the password you set during installation.

If successful, you'll see:

```
postgres=#
```

> 📝 **Note:** The `postgres=#` prompt confirms you are connected as the superuser inside the PostgreSQL interactive shell (`psql`). All subsequent SQL and `\`-commands in this guide are run from this shell unless stated otherwise.

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Create Your Project Database

Inside `psql`, run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE healthcare_ml;
```

Then connect to it:

```sql
\c healthcare_ml
```

You should now see:

```
You are now connected to database "healthcare_ml".
```

> 📝 **Note:** `\c` is a `psql` meta-command (not standard SQL) that switches your active connection to the specified database. All subsequent operations will target `healthcare_ml`.

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Create Project Folder Structure

On your local machine, your project directory should look like:

```
healthcare-readmission-ml/
│
├── data/
│   └── raw/
│       └── diabetic_data.csv      ← dataset goes here
│
├── sql/
│   └── schema.sql
│
└── docs/
```

> 📝 **Note:** Keeping raw data in `data/raw/` and never modifying it is a best practice. It preserves the original source so you can always re-run the pipeline from scratch.

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Create `schema.sql`

Create the file `sql/schema.sql` and paste the following:

```sql
-- Drop table if it exists (safe re-run)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS admissions;

-- Core admissions table matching the UCI dataset columns
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS admissions;

CREATE TABLE admissions (
    encounter_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_nbr BIGINT,
    race VARCHAR(50),
    gender VARCHAR(20),
    age VARCHAR(20),
    weight VARCHAR(20),
    admission_type_id INT,
    discharge_disposition_id INT,
    admission_source_id INT,
    time_in_hospital INT,
    payer_code VARCHAR(20),
    medical_specialty VARCHAR(100),
    num_lab_procedures INT,
    num_procedures INT,
    num_medications INT,
    number_outpatient INT,
    number_emergency INT,
    number_inpatient INT,
    diag_1 VARCHAR(20),
    diag_2 VARCHAR(20),
    diag_3 VARCHAR(20),
    number_diagnoses INT,
    max_glu_serum VARCHAR(20),
    A1Cresult VARCHAR(20),
    metformin VARCHAR(20),
    repaglinide VARCHAR(20),
    nateglinide VARCHAR(20),
    chlorpropamide VARCHAR(20),
    glimepiride VARCHAR(20),
    acetohexamide VARCHAR(20),
    glipizide VARCHAR(20),
    glyburide VARCHAR(20),
    tolbutamide VARCHAR(20),
    pioglitazone VARCHAR(20),
    rosiglitazone VARCHAR(20),
    acarbose VARCHAR(20),
    miglitol VARCHAR(20),
    troglitazone VARCHAR(20),
    tolazamide VARCHAR(20),
    examide VARCHAR(20),
    citoglipton VARCHAR(20),
    insulin VARCHAR(20),
    glyburide_metformin VARCHAR(20),
    glipizide_metformin VARCHAR(20),
    glimepiride_pioglitazone VARCHAR(20),
    metformin_rosiglitazone VARCHAR(20),
    metformin_pioglitazone VARCHAR(20),
    change VARCHAR(10),
    diabetesMed VARCHAR(10),
    readmitted VARCHAR(10)
);
```

> 📝 **Note:** `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` makes the script safely re-runnable — if you re-execute the schema, it won't error on an existing table. This is standard practice in data engineering.

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Execute the Schema

Inside `psql` (connected to `healthcare_ml`), run:

```sql
\i /absolute/path/to/sql/schema.sql
```

**Windows example:**

```sql
\i C:/Users/YourName/healthcare-readmission-ml/sql/schema.sql
```

> ⚠️ **Windows tip:** Use **forward slashes** (`/`), not backslashes (`\`), in `psql` path arguments.

If successful, you'll see:

```
DROP TABLE
CREATE TABLE
```

---

### ✅ Step 6 — Load the Dataset

Use `\copy` (the `psql` client-side command) to import the CSV:

```sql
\copy admissions FROM '/absolute/path/to/data/raw/diabetic_data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

**Windows example:**

```sql
\copy admissions FROM 'C:/Users/YourName/healthcare-readmission-ml/data/raw/diabetic_data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

If successful, you'll see:

```
COPY 101766
```

> 📝 **Note:** `\copy` runs on the _client_ side (your machine), whereas server-side `COPY` requires the file to be on the PostgreSQL server. For local development, always prefer `\copy`.

---

### ✅ Step 7 — Validate the Load

**Check total row count:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM admissions;
```

Expected: **~101,766 rows**

**Check target label distribution:**

```sql
SELECT readmitted, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM admissions
GROUP BY readmitted
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

Expected result (approximate):

| readmitted | count  |
| ---------- | ------ |
| NO         | 54,864 |
| >30        | 35,545 |
| <30        | 11,357 |

> 📝 **Note:** The class imbalance here (the `<30` readmission class is a minority) is a key challenge this project addresses. This distribution will guide your choice of evaluation metrics and resampling strategy.

### 🧠 What You Just Built

```
Raw CSV  →  Structured relational table  →  Queryable healthcare dataset
```

You've done what most students skip — loaded real data into a proper database before touching Python. This makes your analysis reproducible, scalable, and far more professional than notebook-only workflows.
